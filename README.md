## 🚀 About This Repository

This repository is a **daily log of my Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) practice**.  
I am fully committed to practicing **every day**, following a **topic-by-topic and chronological approach**, and documenting everything I learn.

The focus is on **consistency, clarity, and strong fundamentals** rather than rushing through topics.
